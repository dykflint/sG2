They want to get rid of the bus line you always take to work. What can you do to get the bus route?

— ✓ I am taking part in a citizens' initiative for the maintenance of the bus route or I am founding an initiative myself.
— I become a member of a sports club and practice cycling.
— I am contacting the tax office because, as a taxpayer, I have a right to the bus route.
— I am writing a letter to the forestry office of the municipality.
