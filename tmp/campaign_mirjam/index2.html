            Dear friend of SmarterGerman
            In our field we sometimes meet people whose work we love. This happened with Wunderbla. Wunderbla teaches German in a way we love, which is based on a story and microlearning. Each day you get the next small part of a story and exercises which fit your level and are personalised for you. This way you spend 15-20 minutes each day learning German.
            Wunderbla is giving friends of SmarterGerman a 1 month free trial. If you decide to work longer with them and sign up, we will receive a small fee for that. This way you will still support SmarterGerman.
