            <p>Dear German Learners, <br><br>
                With a huge pain in our hearts, we have decided to call it quits. We are giving up.
            </p>
            <p>
                <h3 class="h3-cca">Change the World</h3>
                With optimism and some calculated naivety we have set out to change the world for the better. We believe in every human's desire for equal chances no matter where one comes from, rich or poor, which is why earlier this year we developed our Crazy Community Approach allowing people to choose a price that would fit their income/wealth.<br><br>
                We simplified our product range by bundling our courses together, we lowered our prices to an amount even the poorest of the poor could afford, so we thought, and some customers reached out to us thanking us from their heart for doing so.<br><br>
                But instead of hundreds or thousands of German learners taking advantage of this unique opportunity, too few came or didn’t understand that despite the low price they’d get one of the highest quality products on the market. Unfortunately, that meant that we couldn’t sustain our idea. <br>
            </p>
            <p>
                <h3 class="h3-cca">Pulling the "Notbremse"</h3>
                This month it reached a point where I had to pull the "Notbremse" (emergency break) as otherwise SmarterGerman will exist not much longer and then no one benefits from our fine and heartfelt work. <br>
            </p>
            <p>
                <h3 class="h3-cca">New Prices per November 1</h3>
                So with a heavy heart we will give up our Crazy Community approach and return to our old approach with courses that are still far more affordable than those offered by even our cheapest competitors in India. And we still offer the possibility of paying in very reasonable monthly instalments so that even learners on low or with no income are still able to purchase them. <br><br>
                So, on Nov 1, we will re-introduce our old prices which were and will be as follows: <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>1 level will cost 249 USD*</li>
                    <li>3 levels will cost 499 USD* (save 33% over buying 3 individual levels)</li>
                    <li>5 levels will cost 749 USD* (save 40% over buying 5 individual levels)</li>
                </ul>
                *all prices are excluding VAT <br>
                Until Nov 1, you can still take advantage of our Crazy Community approach. We will never offer such cheap prices again. <br>
            </p>
            <p>
                <h3 class="h3-cca">So what about those that can not afford these new prices?</h3>
                We will think of other ways to support people with a smaller budget and we will keep you posted on how we will do that. One idea I have in mind is something like crowdfunding for students in need or scholarships. Give us some time to work on those ideas, I expect those options after spring 2023. <br><br>
                So, please if you can’t afford a higher price, take advantage of our current pricing approach, where you can still buy our courses for a ridiculously low price (if that is what you need)  as there’s no other course out there that offers such a good quality for such a low amount. <br>
            </p>
            <p>
                <h3 class="h3-cca">Choose “Pay as you can”, while you still can ;)</h3>
